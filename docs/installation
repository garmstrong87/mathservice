mathservice Installation instructions.

This project is a simple web service example.  

The project was developed, deployed, and tested in Ubuntu 12.04 environment 
utilizing python 2.7.3 and the Flask microframework.  It will most likely work
in other Linux and Windows environments with properly configured python and 
Flask installations, but the instructions/examples provided and testing only
considered the Ubuntu 12.04 environment. 

To Ubuntu 12.04 iso and installation instructions can be found at
http://www.ubuntu.com/index_asus.html. 

Python 2.7.3 is the default for Ubuntu 12.04, but can be found at
http://www.python.org/.

Flask can be found at http://flask.pocoo.org/.  To install on Ubuntu first pip
needs to be installed.  This can be done with the command "sudo apt-get install
python-pip". Then the command "sudo pip install Flask" can be run to install Flask.

Install git.  git can be found at .  For Ubuntu perform the command "sudo apt-get 
install git".

The service can now be retrieved from github at 
"https://github.com/garmstrong87/mathservice.git".  On Ubuntu got to where you wish 
to deploy the project and use the git command 
"git clone git://github.com/garmstrong87/mathservice.git".  


The example web service can now be run by typing "python mathservice.py" from 
the mathservice directory where it was deployed from github.

See the example file in the docs directory to show exercising of the service with a
