mathservice test notes.

This project is a simple web service example. 

TUnit tests were created to test the service utilizing the python unittest 
framework.  To run the unit tests created for the service perform the following.
The unit tests are in the tests directory under the mathservice directory.  To 
run the test cd to the tests directory.  Add the mathservice directory to the path.

For ubuntu this can be done by running 

PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:<Path to where you deployed the service>"
Export PYTHONPATH

Then you can run the command "python -m unittest discover".  This will auto 
discover all the unit tests written in the tests directory.  An example of 
the output is as follows:
